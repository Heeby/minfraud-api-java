CHANGELOG
=========

0.3.0 (2016-01-22)
------------------

* Added support for new minFraud Insights outputs. These are:
    * `/credit_card/brand`
    * `/credit_card/type`
    * `/device/id`
    * `/email/is_free`
    * `/emai/is_high_risk`
* The `Warning.getInput()` method has been replaced by
  `Warning.getInputPointer()`, which returns a JSON Pointer rather than array.
* The `ScoreResponse.getId()` and `InsightsResponse.getId()` methods now
  return `UUID` objects instead of strings.

0.2.0 (2016-01-15)
------------------

* Added support for `is_gift` and `has_gift_message` to the order input
  object.
* Jackson now uses the constructors to deserialize to the response model
  classes rather than overriding the access modifiers on them.
* A null pointer bug was fixed in `getInput()` of the `Warning` model when
  the `input` array is not present in the JSON object.
* Update GeoIP2 and other dependencies.

0.1.0 (2015-06-29)
